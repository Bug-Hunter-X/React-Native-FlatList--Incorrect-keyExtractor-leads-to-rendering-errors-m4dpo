This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an incorrect `keyExtractor` function.  The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render items. If this function doesn't return a unique key for each item, FlatList may produce unexpected behavior, including incorrect rendering, unexpected item reordering, and performance issues.  The error message itself is often unspecific, leading to confusion. 

**Example of Incorrect `keyExtractor`:**
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.name} // Incorrect if names are not unique
/>
```

In this case, if two items share the same `name`, the `keyExtractor` will return the same key for both, leading to the error.
